 Question : Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

                            HTTP1.1 AND HTTP2 DIFFERENCE 

     *** HTTP1.1 ****                                         *** HTTP2 *** 


  1. It Works on the textual format.                   1. It works on the binary protocol. 

  2. There is head of line blocking that blocks        2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
     all the requests behind it until it doesn't          connection is required for multiple requests.
     get its all resources.

  3. It uses requests resource inlining for use        3. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all 
     getting multiple pages.                              multiple pages.

  4. It compresses data by itself.                     4. It uses HPACK for data compression. 

  5. It was known to have poor response time           5. It has come with advancements in efficency speed &
     the protocol was losing its efficency.               Security.

  6. A program like Gzip comparession software         6. It uses the HPACK compression software is used to 
     is used to compress the size of CSS and Java         compress the size of encodes the header metadata and 
     -script files to reduce the data size.               reduces the size of the header.


Question : Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

             Title :- Undestanding objects and its internal representation in Javascript

    * Introduction:
           JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform,single threaded,and interpreted compiled programming language.
      It is also known as the scripting language for webpages,It is well known for the development of web pages,and 
      Many non-browser environments also use it.
           Javascript is a weakly typed language. Javascript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server
      -Side developments. Javascript contains a standard library of objects,like Array,Date,and Math, and a core set of
      Language elements like operators,control structures,and Statements.

   * Objects in JavaScript:
           In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and 
      each value can be of any data type, including other objects. Objects in JavaScript can be created
      using object literal syntax, constructor functions, or the class keyword in ES6.

       1. Object Literal Syntax:
            This is the most common way to create objects in JavaScript. You define key-value pairs inside
          curly braces {}, separated by commas.
       2. Constructor Functions:
            You can create objects using constructor functions, which are functions that serve as
          blueprints for creating objects. Inside the constructor function, you use the this keyword
          to refer to the newly created object.
       3. ES6 Classes:
            With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript also supports classes, which are a syntactic sugar
          over constructor functions. Classes provide a more familiar syntax for defining objects and 
          their behavior.
    
  * Internal Representation of Objects:
        Under the hood, objects in JavaScript are represented as key-value maps,where the keys are strings or symbols,
      and the values can be of any type, including other objects or functions. This representation is often referred to 
      as a hash table or hash map.

  * Memory Management:
        JavaScript objects are allocated memory dynamically,and memory management is handled automatically by the JavaScript
     engine's garbage collector.When an object is no longer reachable from the program, it becomes eligible for garbage collection,
     and its memory is reclaimed.

  * Object Serialization:
       JavaScript objects can be serialized into various formats, such as JSON, which represents objects as strings.
     Serialization allows objects to be transmitted over the network or stored in a persistent manner. Conversely, 
     deserialization is the process of reconstructing objects from serialized data.
